# Churn Analysis

## Overview

The "Churn Analysis" component of the "Bank Churn Analysis Insights" project is designed to provide in-depth insights into customer churn within a banking dataset. This component combines data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and data visualization techniques to help stakeholders understand and analyze customer behavior and churn patterns.

## Prerequisites

Before using the "Churn Analysis" component, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (specified in the "requirements.txt" file)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To perform churn analysis using this component, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have completed the installation and have the dataset in place.

2. Open the churn_analysis.py script in your preferred Python development environment.

3. Customize the script as needed, including any feature selection, parameter adjustments, or additional visualizations.

4. Run the churn_analysis.py script. It will execute the following steps:
    1. Load the dataset.
    2. Display summary statistics of the dataset.
    3. Standardize the data.
    4. Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
    5. Apply K-Means clustering to create customer clusters.
    6. Visualize the clusters using a scatterplot.
    7. Create age groups and generate a faceted bar plot.
    8. Produce a stacked bar plot to analyze churn by gender and geography.
    9. Create a categorical variable for zero balance accounts and visualize it using a mosaic plot.
        
Examine the generated visualizations and insights to gain a deeper understanding of customer churn.

## Code Details
The churn_analysis.py script includes the following key components:
  * Data loading and preprocessing.
  * Standardization of data for analysis.
  * Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
  * K-Means clustering for customer segmentation.
  * Generation of various data visualizations to analyze churn patterns and demographics.

You can explore the code and comments within the script to understand the implementation details.
